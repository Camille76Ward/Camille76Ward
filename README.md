## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a full-stack developer with experience building fast, full-featured web applications using Django on the backend and React on the frontend. This repository serves as a collection of projects, experiments, and practical examples that highlight my work across both server-side and client-side development.

With Django, I focus on building secure, scalable APIs and backend systems that handle business logic, data modeling, and user authentication. I enjoy working with Djangoâ€™s powerful ORM, views, and admin interface to quickly bring ideas to life and create reliable foundations for web applications.

On the frontend, I use React to build dynamic, responsive interfaces that deliver smooth user experiences. Iâ€™ve worked with tools like React Router, hooks, and context for state management, and Iâ€™m always looking to make UI components modular, maintainable, and easy to scale. Integrating Django with React allows me to create seamless full-stack workflowsâ€”from database to browser.

In addition to core development, Iâ€™m familiar with REST API integration, basic DevOps practices, and deploying full-stack applications using platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Docker. I aim to follow modern development practices, including clean code principles, version control with Git, and continuous learning.

This repository includes a mix of full-stack apps, frontend and backend components, and notes from my learning journey. Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer, a student, or someone exploring web development, feel free to browse, fork, or contribute to any of the projects here.

Thanks for visiting! I hope you find something helpful or inspiring as I continue to grow and build in the world of full-stack development with Django and React.
